Showcase
========
Introduction
------------
Showcase is a gallery type wordpress theme that utilizes AJAX and responsive design via the integration of the [Roots theme](https://github.com/retlehs/roots). 

**Audience**
This Wordpress theme has been designed as a protfolio for *Artists*, and *Designers* however, this theme can serve as a portfolio for just about any personal website.

Features
--------
Showcase features a fully functional AJAX website that is responsive!

**Resonsive**
This theme has been configured to load your pages in a manner that will make it visually appealing to both computers and mobile/tablet devices. This is done thanks to the Roots theme and Twitter's Bootstrapper Responsive CSS.

**AJAX**
This theme been developed to load all of the pages on the first page that is visited. What this means is that when a user visits the home page, the site loads all of the subsequent pages of the site. The content of these pages are placed into "*slides*" these *slides* can be navigated to by clicking on the navigation elements, or  by scrolling to the left and right of the website.
*NOTE: The process of loading multiple pages can be taxing on a system, especially for mobile devices! It is recommended to load as few pages as possible to increase performance.*

Adding Slides
-------------
To add a *slide* to the theme, simply add a new page as you would with a normal Wordpress Install, when this is done, make sure that the page is added to the primary navigation menu in the *Appearance* section. The theme will then load those pages and add them to thier slides in the order that they appear in the menu!
